  OpenRTI-2.0.0 (development)
 ----------------------------
 
 This is a derivative work / spin-off of the original OpenRTI project.
 Several extensions & updates have been done:
 * dumped c++98 compatibility in favor of C++11
 * some extensions to the original RTI services:
	* interaction subscriptions filtered by parameter values
	* ability to let the RTI signal a given notification handle when callbacks are available
	* unsubscribe object instance updates (after these have been discovered)
 * partial MOM implementation
 * HLA_IMMEDIATE callback model
 * full multi-threading safety for in the API
 * true protocol version checks with provisions for compatability
 * simplified data type encoding infrastructure, the requirement to have data to be aligned 'on the wire' has been dropped
 * uncounted bug corrections
 * a code generator which will generate C++ classes from a FOM's data types definitions. The generated classes can be used to 
   easily translate between application data objects and encodings to be used for attribute values or interaction parameters.
Because this spin-off is no longer compatible to the HLA 1516e standard, the API has been put into a new namespace 
(rti1516ev, as 'enhanced by vector GmbH').

OpenRTI-0.10.0 (development)
 ----------------------------
 
 * Fix logical time interval implementation for rti1516{,e}.
 * Fix logical time implementation for RTI13.
 * Try to prevent overflow with c++11 and infinite timeouts.
 * RTI13: Prefer rti13 fed files over xml files in fed file parsing.
 * Silence gcc warnings - rti can't adhere to that.
 * For a more detailed list of changes see the git history.
